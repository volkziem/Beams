Chapter 1: Introduction
======================

The answer to "what is physics?" provides the book's theme: to figure out the world and build
the instruments to help with the figuring. By focusing on the press conference
at CERN where the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced, the link between the figuring
(Higgs boson as last puzzle bit of the standard model) and the instruments (the Large Hadron
Collider and the detectors) is firmly established. The chapter then illustrates how physics
advances by distilling experiments into physical laws, a process referred to as 'unification'.

Chapter 2: Accelerator prehistory
================================

Crookes tube are introduced as precursors to cathode ray tubes that
produce the first beams. These rays turned out to be the first
elementary particle, the electron. Both X-ray tubes and triodes as the
first electronic components are only the two most significant inventions
that mark the technological spinoff.

Chapter 3: Nature\'s accelerators
================================

Rutherford\'s great idea to use radioactive sources for scattering
experiments leads to Bohr\'s model of the atom. Positrons, muons, pions, an
V-particles that behave strangely\" are found in cosmic rays. The strong
nuclear force and the weak interaction emerge as two fundamental forces
besides electromagnetic forces and gravity. The strong force is
responsible for the stability of atomic nuclei, whereas the weak
interaction causes the spontaneous decay of particles that is associated
with radioactivity. Photographic plates, cloud chambers, and Geiger
counters are discussed as the detectors used to analyze subatomic
reactions.

Chapter 4: The echo of Rutherford\'s call
========================================

Rutherford\'s vision of man-made particle sources leads to early
accelerators, among them the Cockroft-Walton and van de Graaff
accelerators, as well as cyclotrons. They are used to produce new
elements and isotopes, such as technetium, tritium, and carbon-14.
Especially cyclotrons are instrumental in treating cancer patients and
producing material for atomic bombs. After the invention of phase
focusing much higher energy became accessible, making a systematic study
of the nuclear forces possible. But the energy is still insufficient to
produce V-particles that will play a crucial role in understanding the
weak interaction.

Chapter 5: The Cosmotron meets the strangeness of physics
========================================================

A great idea (synchrotrons) leads to the construction of the Cosmotron
and the Bevatron, where the antiproton was discovered. The ability of
the new synchrotrons to produce large numbers of V-particles opens up
the way for systematic studies that lead to the concept of strangeness.
Moreover, it reveals the weird behavior of V-particles in the weak
interaction and especially the so-called \'violation of parity.\' The
antiproton and many, many more new particles, populating the \"zoo\"
that desperately was in need of an ordering scheme.

Chapter 6: CERN and the taming of the zoo
========================================

A great idea (alternating-gradient focusing) leads to the construction
of the PS at CERN and the AGS in Brookhaven as members of the second
generation of synchrotrons. They significantly extend the energy range
of accelerators and find the muon neutrino, weak neutral currents, and
an asymmetry between matter and antimatter. The quark model emerges as
the ordering scheme behind the \"zoo\" and predicts the Omega-minus
particle, which is subsequently discovered in the AGS. But why are free
quarks never observed?

Chapter 7: A monster encounters quarks
=====================================

A great idea (klystrons) leads to electron linear accelerators all the
way to the 3 km long \'monster.\' They are first used to determine the
size of nuclei and then to look deep inside protons, where partons were
discovered that were later identified with the quarks. Quantum
chromodynamics emerges as a theory for the strong nuclear force that
even explains why quarks are quasi-free inside protons, but can never
escape individually.

Chapter 8: Spearheading charm
============================

The great idea to build electron-positron collider rings and to squeeze
the beams to small dimensions at the collision point leads to the
discovery of the fourth quark, called \'charm.\' The concept of particle
generations emerges and soon the tau, as the first member of the third
generation, is discovered. Larger rings, operating at higher energy,
discover gluons as force-carriers of quantum chromodynamics.

Chapter 9: The Tevatron and generation matters
=============================================

Great ideas (cascaded accelerators, separate function magnets,
superconducting magnets) enable the third generation of proton
synchrotrons (Main ring at Fermilab, SPS at CERN). The fifth quark,
called \'bottom\', is discovered at Fermilab. The Intersecting Storage
Ring at CERN is the first proton-proton collider where much of the
technology was developed to make later colliders possible. In
particular, the great idea to use stochastic cooling to accumulate
sufficient numbers of antiprotons makes operation of proton-antiproton
colliders possible. First the SPS is converted to a proton-antiproton
collider and discovers the Z and W bosons as the force-carriers of the
weak force. The Tevatron at Fermilab discovers the sixths quark, called
\'top\' and the tau neutrino, which completes the third generation of
particles.

Chapter 10: Particle horns of plenty
===================================

The proton colliders from the previous chapter reached high energies and
discovered new particles, but only in very small numbers. Precision
measurements to determine their properties required much higher
collision rates with point-like particles. The electron-positron
colliders LEP and SLC measured many properties of the Z boson that
indicate only three generations of elementary particles exist. After
upgrading LEP with superconducting cavities, W bosons could be produced
and helped to pin down many properties of the standard model of particle
physics. B-factories produced copious numbers of B mesons that allowed
to investigate their decay, which is closely linked to the preponderance
of matter over antimatter in our universe.

Chapter 11: Large hadron colliders
=================================

A great idea (two-in-one magnets) makes it possible to install the
proton-proton collider LHC in the tunnel previously occupied by LEP. It
was tasked to find the last missing particle of the standard model, the
Higgs boson. Enabled by a very large beam energies and intensities this
elusive particle was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS detectors in 2012.
Subsequently many other of its parameters were determined. In the future
upgrades to higher collision rates and to higher energies will expand
the capabilities of LHC far beyond the present level.

Chapter 12: Future accelerators
==============================

Several candidates for future accelerators are discussed. The linear
colliders ILC and CLIC will provide electron-positron collision at much
higher energy than previously accessible in LEP or SLC. They will
explore many details of the Higgs boson and carefully determine its
properties. Another candidate for a future accelerator to address the
physics of the Higgs boson is the Future Circular Collider (FCC). This
large ring will have three times the circumference of LHC. A high-energy
muon collider will provide point-like collisions with moderately heavy
particles, albeit at the expense of the short lifetime of muons. Many
technical details of this approach need to be worked out in the future.
Plasma accelerators provide another option to reach high particle
energies. They work by exciting plasma waves in a gas and using the
emerging electric field to accelerate particles to high energies.

This chapter gives a brief account of synchrotron-light sources and
free-electron lasers followed by a description of spallation neutron
sources spallation neutron sources. These accelerator use light or
neutrons to analyze samples on the atomic scale. Cyclotrons and electron
linear accelerators are used for medical applications. in particular to
treat cancer and to diagnose illnesses. Industrial accelerators are
essential for manufacturing computer chips, to analyze samples from
material and life sciences, and to date materials of cultural heritage.

Chapter 14: Epilogue
===================

This chapter summarizes the standard model of elementary particles and
points out a number of open questions, among them what dark matter of
dark energy are. This suggests that there is a lot of \'figuring out\'
to do.
